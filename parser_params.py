When cache miss occurs and a function decorated with @deterministic is processed, its result is stored in NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY. This way, only the elements of NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY are added to the database at the end of the execution.\n\
    =>2d-ad-t : two dicionaries (2d), all data loaded at the begining with a thread (ad-t), 4th implementation of dictionary (uses 2 dictionaries): at the begining of the execution a thread is started to load all the data cached in the database to the dictionary DATA_DICTIONARY. When cache miss occurs and a function decorated with @deterministic is processed, its result is stored in NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY. Only the elements of NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY are added to the database at the end of the execution but it is possible that some elements in NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY are already in the database due to the concurrent execution of the experiment and the thread that populates DATA_DICTIONARY.\n\
    =>2d-ad-f : two dicionaries (2d), all data loaded at the begining of a function(ad-f), 5th implementation of dictionary (uses 2 dictionaries): when @deterministic is executed a select query is created to the database to bring all results of the function decorated with @deterministic stored in the cache. A list of functions already inserted to the dictionary is maintained to avoid unecessary querys to the database. The results are then stored in the dictionary DATA_DICTIONARY. When cache miss occurs and a function decorated with @deterministic is processed, its result is stored in NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY. This way, only the elements of NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY are added to the database at the end of the execution.\n\
    =>2d-ad-ft: two dicionaries (2d), all data loaded at the begining of a function with a thread (ad-ft), 6th implementation of dictionary (uses 2 dictionaries): when @deterministic is executed a select query is created to the database to bring all results of the function decorated with @deterministic stored in the cache. A list of functions already inserted to the dictionary is maintained to avoid unecessary querys to the database. The results of the query are stored in the dictionary DATA_DICTIONARY by a thread. When cache miss occurs and a function decorated with @deterministic is processed, its result is stored in NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY. This way, only the elements of NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY are added to the database at the end of the execution.\n\
    =>2d-lz   : two dicionaries (2d), lazy mode (lz), 7th implementation of dictionary (uses 2 dictionaries): new data is added to DATA_DICTIONARY when cache hit occurs (LAZY approach) and new data is added to NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY when cache miss occur and the function decorated with @deterministic is executed.\n\n"
